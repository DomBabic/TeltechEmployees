 Example:
 App can define different entry points. App could have been launched by a new user or already logged in user.
 These entry points can be used to setup initial app scenes based on information available (or unavailable) on user.

/*
 Example:
 Existing user is logged into the app. On app launch user would land on 'Home' view, from there user might choose
 to navigate to a history view displaying some historic data, perhaps they want to navigate to profile section.
 Deeplinking into the app might cause user to hand on something other than home.

/*
 Example:
 On new app install users would probably land on a view designed with First Time User Experience in mind.
 This view might contain some descriptive informations on the app.
 From here users would be given an option to navigate to login or signup flow.
 In case of a marketing campaign, app might implement a deeplink which would navigate users to signup,
 in some cases account might be provided for user and deeplink would cause them to be taken to login.
